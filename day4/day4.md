if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

Example
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
  

  #LOOPING
  ##for and while Loop

  ##The for Loop
    #A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

    #This is less like the for keyword in other programming

    to print values = 
    dict1 = {'name': 'Jay', 'age': 20, 'gender': 'male'}

for i in dict1.values():
    print(i)
