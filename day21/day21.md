[[3435,  556],
[ 542, 3248]]     here 2d array is 
##### [[TP]][FP]       
True positive = your value is True and your predicted value is also True then it increse by 1   FAlse Positive = 0 
False Positive = Actual value is false but predicted as true that is False Poistive
##### [FN][TN]          
FN = ACtual value is True but predicted as FALSE
TN = Acrual value is False and predicted as False


Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples (TP+TN+FP+FN)
