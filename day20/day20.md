superwise Learning  = In supervised learning, an algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

If you're asking for a definition, here it is:

**Supervised Learning**: Supervised Learning is a category of machine learning algorithms that are trained using labeled example inputs and outputs. The algorithm learns a mapping from inputs to outputs and uses it to predict the output for unseen data.

If you're asking for something else related to "supervised learning", could you please provide more details?
