Types of ML

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset. That is, the correct answer (label) is provided for each example in the training dataset. The model learns to predict labels for new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Regression - 
Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning and statistics. It's used to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on one or more predictor variables (x). 

The main goal of regression analysis is to understand how the value of the dependent variable changes when one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

There are several types of regression models, including:

1. **Linear Regression**: Assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (Y).

2. **Logistic Regression**: Used when the dependent variable is binary in nature.

3. **Polynomial Regression**: Used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variable is non-linear.

4. **Ridge Regression**: A technique used when the data suffers from multicollinearity (independent variables are highly correlated).

5. **Lasso Regression**: Similar to Ridge Regression, but it can lead to feature selection.

6. **ElasticNet Regression**: A regularized regression method that combines both L1 and L2 as the penalty term.
