Numpy= numpy is almost same as list but in numpy you can store more element and numpy is faster than list. Numpy is used for mathematical operation.   
Numpy is a library of python. used for data science and machine learning. Numpy is used to store large amount of data as list has limitation.
Array is a collection of similar data type. 
array is a homogenous data type here all data type is same.
if any 

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
print(arr)
print(arr[0:5])
print(arr[5:11])
print(type(arr))
